The **OWASP AI Maturity Assessment (AIMA)** helps organizations assess, guide, and improve their use of Artificial Intelligence. As AI becomes central to modern software and decision-making, AIMA provides a practical, structured approach for ensuring responsible, secure, and effective AI integration.

AIMA supports organizations in evaluating how well their AI systems align with strategic goals, ethical principles, and operational needs. The model spans five core domains: Strategy, Design, Implementation, Operations, and Governance. Each domain includes actionable maturity levels to guide adoption and improvement.

Built as a community-driven OWASP project, AIMA draws on established practices in software assurance while addressing the unique challenges posed by AI—such as explainability, data risks, and adversarial threats.
