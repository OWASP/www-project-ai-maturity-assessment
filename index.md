With the growing interest and adoption of AI technologies, it's critical to establish a framework that organizations can use to measure and enhance their AI maturity levels.

In recent months, several AI Maturity Models have emerged, including the MITRE AI Framework, which highlights the need for structured AI assessments. Building on this momentum, I propose the development of the OWASP AI Maturity Assessment (AIMA), using the Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) as a foundation.

Mission Statement:
The OWASP AI Maturity Assessment (AIMA) aims to be the premier framework that enables organizations to assess, analyze, and improve the security and responsible usage of AI technologies. Like OWASP SAMM, AIMA will be technology and process agnostic, delivering a risk-driven approach that guides organizations in managing AI systems throughout their entire lifecycle.

Key focus areas will include:

* Ethics: Ensuring AI development and deployment align with ethical standards.
* Security: Protecting AI systems from potential vulnerabilities and threats.
* Governance: Providing a structured approach to AI risk management, compliance, and accountability.

### Road Map
Phase 1: Initial Draft and Community Engagement (January to March 2025)

* Publish the first draft of the core project framework. This will outline the vision, mission, and foundational structure of AIMA.
* Set up a dedicated team to support the development and promotion of AIMA.
* Launch community engagement initiatives to gather input and foster brainstorming sessions, driving collective feedback on the initial draft.

Phase 2: Framework Development and Pilot Testing (April to June 2025)

* Refine the initial draft based on community feedback, and develop a more detailed framework covering the key areas: ethics, security, and governance.
* Initiate pilot testing with a selection of organizations to validate the framework's effectiveness and gather real-world insights.
* Expand community outreach to build partnerships and secure contributions from industry experts.

Phase 3: Presentation and Outreach at OWASP Conferences (July 2025)

* Finalize the initial version of the AIMA framework, incorporating feedback and insights from pilot testing.
* Present the AIMA framework at OWASP Conferences to reach a broader audience, share findings, and gather further input.
* Host workshops and panel discussions at the conferences to engage with security professionals, AI practitioners, and stakeholders, promoting broader adoption and community involvement.
