### User Control and Transparency

User Control and Transparency are essential pillars of responsible AI and digital product design. They ensure users understand how their data is used and have meaningful agency over that use. This maturity model guides organizations in progressing from minimal disclosure to embedded, proactive transparency and user empowerment. It emphasizes both governance structures and practical implementation in design and engineering workflows. The goal is to build trust, comply with regulatory expectations, and respect user autonomy across the product lifecycle.

#### Objectives

1. **User Information Transparency**: Provide users with clear, accessible, and timely information about how their data and AI-powered features operate.
2. **User Control and Consent**: Enable meaningful user control over data use, personalization, consent, and algorithmic decisions.
3. **Governance for User Engagement**: Establish governance policies that define standards for disclosure, consent, and user engagement.
4. **Design Enablement for Transparency**: Equip product and engineering teams with design patterns, APIs, and UI components to support transparency and control.
5. **Feedback-Driven Improvement**: Continuously evaluate and improve user-facing transparency mechanisms through metrics and user feedback.

| **1 – Establish User control** practices and transparency mechanisms that are  legally required.                                             | - **Opaque Communication:** Disclosures are written in legal terms with limited accessibility.<br>- **Generic Consent:** Consent mechanisms are generic and often bundled.<br>- **Unclear Ownership:** No clear ownership for transparency or user agency.                                                               | - **Inconsistent UI:** UI elements for control (e.g. toggles, preferences) are ad hoc and hard-coded.<br>- **No Design Standards:** No reusable components or design guidelines for transparency.<br>- **Limited User Access:** Users cannot access or manage their data effectively.                                                |
| **2 – Defined Policies and workflows**  to standardize user control and disclosure practices.                                                | - **Policy Enforcement:** A user transparency and control policy is published and enforced.<br>- **Assigned Roles:** Roles (e.g., UX Privacy Leads or Product Compliance Liaisons) are assigned.<br>- **Reviewed Consent Flows:** User consent flows are aligned with legal bases and reviewed periodically.               | - **Standardized Interfaces:** Common UI patterns are introduced for preferences, opt-ins/outs, and data visibility.<br>- **Process Integration:** Consent and disclosure flows are reviewed in design and development phases.<br>- **Consistent Access:** APIs are used to give users access, edit, and delete data consistently.         |
| **3 – Optimized transparency and user control** processes are embedded by default and continuously improved through feedback and automation. | - **Measured Transparency:** User transparency KPIs (e.g. consent clarity, user opt-out rates) are tracked across products.<br>- **Live Consent Tracking:** Real-time consent and preference tracking is integrated with systems.<br>- **Contextual Explanations:** User-facing explanations are tailored based on context and usage. | - **Adaptive Components:** Dynamic UI components adapt transparency and control options based on user needs.<br>- **Feedback-Driven Design:** Feedback loops inform design updates based on user behavior and satisfaction.<br>- **Comprehensive Control Panels:** Privacy dashboards and granular controls are standard in all user-facing systems. |
