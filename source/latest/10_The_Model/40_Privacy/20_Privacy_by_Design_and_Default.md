### Privacy by Design and Default

Privacy by Design and Default (PbD&D) is a foundational principle for building trustworthy and compliant digital systems. It helps organizations assess and evolve their privacy practices from reactive to proactive implementation. It emphasizes integrating privacy into both governance frameworks and technical workflows. The objective is to ensure privacy is not an afterthought but a core design feature across the entire lifecycle. By progressing through the levels, organizations can move toward automated, measurable, and scalable privacy practices.

#### Objectives

1. **Privacy by Design**: Embed privacy principles into system design and development from the outset, rather than addressing them post-deployment.
2. **Governance and Accountability**: Establish clear roles, policies, and accountability for privacy management across teams and functions.
3. **Enablement through Tools and Patterns**: Equip engineering and design teams with reusable tools, patterns, and frameworks to implement privacy by default.
4. **Pipeline Integration**: Integrate privacy assessments and controls into development pipelines, CI/CD workflows, and governance reviews.
5. **Continuous Privacy Improvement**: Continuously monitor, measure, and improve privacy effectiveness using KPIs and automation.

| **1 – Establish a privacy program** addressing privacy risks and user compliant.                                     | - **Ad Hoc Practices:** Privacy risks are addressed post-deployment and handled case-by-case.<br>- **Missing Standards:** No standardized processes for data minimization, DPIAs, or policy application.<br>- **Manual Communication:** Privacy notices and consents are manually generated, often retroactively.              | - **No Privacy Engineering:** Developers and designers operate without privacy design patterns or reusable components.<br>- **Lack of Tools:** No standard tools for consent, purpose limitation, or data classification.<br>- **Reliance on Individuals:** Teams depend on personal initiative rather than embedded technical safeguards.                                      |
| **2 – Define a formal privacy program** with well defined privacy practices, policies and assigned responsibilities. | - **Policy Adoption:** A Privacy by Design policy is published and adopted organization-wide.<br>- **Assigned Roles:** Privacy Officers or Data Stewards are appointed to oversee compliance.<br>- **Integrated Processes:** DPIAs and privacy reviews are integrated into product development and procurement lifecycles. | - **Reusable Components:** Privacy design patterns and libraries (e.g., consent modules, data masking APIs) are made available.<br>- **Process Guidance:** Templates and checklists guide teams through privacy requirements in design and development phases.<br>- **Shared Tooling:** Teams use shared SDKs for compliant data handling and user control mechanisms. |
| **3 – Continuously improve the Privacy program** with automation and monitoring of key metrics.                      | - **Automated Governance:** DPIAs and approvals are integrated into CI/CD with automated gates.<br>- **Code-Level Enforcement:** Data retention, access controls, and minimization are enforced via code.<br>- **Data-Driven Review:** Privacy KPIs are reviewed quarterly and linked to org-wide OKRs.                               | - **Embedded PETs:** Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) like differential privacy and synthetic data are provided by default.<br>- **Integrated Safeguards:** Privacy controls are embedded into design systems and dev workflows.<br>- **Continuous Metrics:** Metrics on privacy defaults and user control coverage are continuously monitored and improved.         |
