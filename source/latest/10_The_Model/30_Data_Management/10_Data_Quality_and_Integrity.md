### Data Quality and Integrity

In the context of AI readiness, data quality and data integrity are foundational pillars that determine the effectiveness, reliability, and trustworthiness of AI systems. AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. High-quality data ensures that models learn meaningful patterns, produce accurate predictions, and adapt well to changing environments. Integrity safeguards that data remains consistent, accurate, and trustworthy across its lifecycle i.e. from ingestion and processing to storage and consumption. Without robust data quality and integrity practices, organizations risk introducing bias, inaccuracies, compliance violations, and operational inefficiencies into their AI initiatives, ultimately undermining the business value AI is intended to deliver.

Definitions:

1. Data Quality for AI-ready data refers to the degree to which data is accurate, complete, consistent, timely, relevant, and fit for use in training, validating, and deploying AI models.
2. Data Integrity refers to the assurance that data remains authentic, reliable, and unaltered throughout its lifecycle, with robust mechanisms for traceability, auditability, and protection against corruption or unauthorized modifications.

#### Objectives

1. **Establish Data Fitness for Advanced AI Systems**: Ensure organizational data assets meet the stringent requirements for training, fine-tuning, and operating LLMs and agentic AI systems, including breadth, depth, freshness, and minimal noise or bias.
2. **Enable Scalable and Trustworthy AI Deployment**: Create a consistent foundation where AI models, including autonomous agents, can safely consume, reason over, and act upon data without human intervention compromising operational integrity.
3. **Identify and Prioritize Risk Areas**: Detect gaps in data sourcing, governance, and lifecycle management that could expose AI systems to risks such as model drift, data poisoning, decision errors, or compliance failures.
