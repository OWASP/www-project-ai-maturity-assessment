# The AIMA Model 

The Artificial Intelligence Maturity Assessment (AIMA) model emerges as a groundbreaking framework designed to guide organizations in designing, developing and deploying responsible and trustworthy AI systems. At its core, AIMA integrates robust Responsible AI (RAI) principles, strategic AI governance practices, and comprehensive alignment with critical business functions, creating a clear pathway towards AI maturity.

AIMA defines eight assessment domains that span the entire AI system lifecycle:

- **Responsible AI Principles**: Fairness, transparency, and societal impact.
- **Governance**: Strategy, policy, and education.
- **Data Management**: Quality, accountability, and training data practices.
- **Privacy**: Data minimization, privacy by design, and user control.
- **Design**: Threat modeling, security architecture, and requirements.
- **Implementation**: Secure build, deployment, and defect management.
- **Verification**: Testing and architecture validation.
- **Operations**: Monitoring, incident response, and system lifecycle management.

Each domain includes maturity criteria grouped into two complementary streams: _Create & Promote_ (stream A) and _Measure & Improve_ (stream B). Organizations can evaluate their posture, identify gaps, and prioritize improvements in a structured way.

This structured approach begins with foundational ethical values, emphasizing the societal impacts of AI, transparency and explainability of models, and proactively addressing fairness and bias. Building on these core values, AIMA incorporates detailed governance strategies to ensure organizations not only comply with regulatory demands but proactively shape internal policies, measurable strategies, and cultivate ongoing awareness and education among stakeholders.

Moreover, the AIMA model uniquely connects these overarching principles and governance practices directly with tangible business processes. By meticulously outlining critical areas—from Data Management and Privacy to Design, Implementation, Verification, and Operational practices—it empowers organizations to systematically evaluate and enhance their AI capabilities, ensuring secure, reliable, and ethical AI adoption. Through this integrated, holistic perspective, AIMA equips organizations to navigate the complexities of AI, promoting sustainable innovation and long-term success.

In the next chapters we will describe each of the Practices described in the model.
