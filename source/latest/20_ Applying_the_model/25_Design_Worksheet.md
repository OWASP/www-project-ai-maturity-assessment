## Design Assessment Worksheet

Below is a sample **Design domain assessment worksheet**. It is organized by practice (Threat Assessment, Security Architecture, Security Requirements) and grouped by maturity level. For each question, an assessor would mark **Yes or No** to indicate whether the organization currently fulfills that criterion. Achieving all “Yes” answers in Level 1 for a given practice indicates maturity Level 1 is attained; all Level 1 and Level 2 “Yes” indicates Level 2, and so on. (Partial “Yes” in the next level would be noted as a “+” as discussed.)

#### Threat Assessment – Identifying and managing security threats specific to AI systems.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Threat Identification                                                               | Stream B: Threat Mitigation                                                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1        | Is there basic awareness or informal identification of threats specific to AI systems?        | Are informal threat mitigation strategies occasionally discussed or implemented?            |
| Level 2        | Are threats systematically identified and documented for AI systems?                          | Are documented mitigation strategies developed and periodically reviewed?                   |
| Level 3        | Is comprehensive threat assessment consistently performed and integrated across AI lifecycle? | Are proactive and comprehensive mitigation strategies continuously implemented and refined? |

#### Security Architecture – Designing secure AI system architectures.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Secure Model Deployment                                                       | Stream B: Architectural Compliance                                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Level 1        | Is initial security awareness or informal consideration present in AI deployment?       | Are informal checks occasionally performed to ensure architectural compliance?       |
| Level 2        | Are formal procedures established for secure AI model deployment?                       | Are regular architectural compliance reviews systematically conducted?               |
| Level 3        | Is secure deployment consistently enforced, continuously refined, and fully integrated? | Is comprehensive architectural compliance proactively managed and regularly audited? |

#### Security Requirements – Defining clear and actionable security criteria for AI systems.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Requirements Definition                                                              | Stream B: Requirements Verification                                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Level 1        | Are security requirements informally identified or sporadically documented?                    | Are informal verification processes occasionally applied to security requirements?         |
| Level 2        | Are security requirements formally documented, clearly defined, and consistently communicated? | Are systematic verification procedures regularly conducted to ensure requirements are met? |
| Level 3        | Are security requirements continuously improved and fully integrated across AI projects?       | Are comprehensive and proactive verification mechanisms consistently enforced and audited? |
