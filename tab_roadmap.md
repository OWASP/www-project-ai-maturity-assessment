# Roadmap – Post V1

On August, 11th 2025 Version 1.0 of the OWASP AI Maturity Assessment (AIMA) has been released.

---

## Phase 1 - Feedback & Adoption (Aug–Nov 2025)

- Create the official OWASP AIMA Presentation to use to present the project inside your organization or at the OWASP Meetings.
- Start dissemination of the project: identify a set of conferences to promote a talk on OWASP AIMA
- Collect structured feedback via:
    - GitHub Issues
    - Community surveys
    - Pilot interviews and workshops
- Support early adopters and publish case studies
- Improve usability (tooling, examples, cross-references)
- Launch translation efforts (starting with German)

---

## Phase 2 - Planned Enhancements (Winter 2025/26 and beyond)

- Add optional modules and extensions:
    - Sector-specific (e.g. healthcare, critical infrastructure)
    - Capability-specific (e.g. LLM Security, GenAI-specific mapping)
- Define contribution and review workflows for extensions
- Begin drafting V1.1 (non-breaking improvements)
- Evaluate scope and need for a potential V2 (only if substantial changes are needed)

---

## Phase 3 - Ongoing Initiatives

- Present AIMA at OWASP and external events
- Publish webinars, explainers, and educational material
- Collaborate with standards bodies (e.g. NIST, ENISA, ISO, EU AI Act alignment)
- Encourage academic engagement (e.g. thesis projects, curriculum adoption)

---

## Versioning and Release Cadence

- V1.1: Targeted for Spring 2026 (incremental refinements)
- V2: No target date — planned only for structural overhauls
- All contributions will follow a documented GitHub-based review process
