# Preface

In recent years, innovation has accelerated at an unprecedented pace, yet our collective ability to ensure that AI systems are secure, trustworthy, and aligned with human values has struggled to keep pace.

The need for structured guidance across the software industry isn’t new. In 2008, OWASP SAMM introduced a pragmatic maturity model that helped thousands of organizations embed security into their software development lifecycle. Today, we face a similar inflection point with Artificial Intelligence. The OWASP AI Maturity Assessment (AIMA) is our response.

AIMA adapts the foundational concepts of OWASP SAMM to the unique realities of AI lifecycle engineering. It expands traditional application security controls to include safeguards for data provenance, model robustness, privacy, fairness, and transparency.

This document is written for CISOs, AI/ML engineers, product leads, auditors, and policymakers who must translate high-level principles into day-to-day engineering decisions. Each maturity level is linked to tangible activities, artifacts, and metrics; enabling incremental improvement rather than disruptive transformation.

Version 1.0 includes eight assessment domains, detailed maturity criteria, and a worksheet that supports both internal evaluations and third-party assessments, helping you identify and mitigate risks across your AI supply chain.

A maturity model is only as strong as the community that shapes it. We invite open collaboration, through GitHub issues, pull requests, pilot assessments, and conference discussions. Your feedback will help us refine scoring criteria, expand domain-specific guidance, and promote technical rigor across use cases.

We extend our deepest gratitude to the OWASP Foundation, the SAMM core team, early reviewers across academia and industry, and the volunteers who contributed test cases, glossary entries, and real-world anecdotes.

We view this release as a living document. It will evolve with new research, regulatory changes, and field experience—and we look forward to your insights in shaping its future.

Onward,
