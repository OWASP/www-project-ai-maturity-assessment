### Security Requirements

The **Security Requirements** practice ensures that AI systems are designed with clear, comprehensive guidelines addressing ethical, legal, and technical risks. Unlike traditional software, AI systems introduce unique challenges, including ethical considerations, compliance with emerging regulations, and vulnerabilities arising from complex data dependencies and model behaviors. Establishing explicit, documented security requirements early in the design phase helps mitigate these risks, supporting responsible innovation and secure AI deployments.

#### Objective

- **Define explicit requirements to address ethical, legal, and technical AI risks.**

#### Streams

| Maturity Level | Stream A – Ethical & Compliance Requirements | Stream B – Data & Model Provenance |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **1 – Baseline Documentation of Requirements** | - **Baseline Ethical Guidelines:** Document foundational ethical guidelines addressing bias, fairness, transparency, and compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, EU AI Act).<br>- **Basic Compliance Measures:** Initial strategies for meeting regulatory requirements (e.g., data privacy, user consent).<br>- **General Awareness:** Stakeholders have basic awareness of ethical and compliance obligations. | - **Basic Data Provenance:** Document initial sources of training data and maintain basic data lineage records.<br>- **Manual Tracking:** Data provenance records are manually created and updated, with limited standardization or automation.<br>- **Limited Visibility:** Partial visibility into third-party data and model components. |
| **2 – Standardized Implementation and Validation** | - **Standardized Bias & Fairness Tools:** Implement standardized tools for bias detection and fairness measurement within training pipelines and application outputs.<br>- **Integrated Compliance Processes:** Consistent application of compliance controls (e.g., automated checks for GDPR compliance, consent verification).<br>- **Structured Documentation:** Ethical and compliance measures systematically documented and regularly reviewed. | - **Automated Quality Checks:** Automate validation processes for third-party datasets and AI models, including quality assurance and security assessments.<br>- **Enhanced Provenance Records:** Automated maintenance of detailed data lineage and provenance documentation, ensuring traceability and accountability.<br>- **Structured Validation:** Standardized criteria established for acceptance of third-party components. |
| **3 – Automated and Continuous Compliance Assurance** | - **Real-Time Compliance Monitoring:** Automated compliance checks integrated throughout AI system lifecycles, with real-time audit trails and immediate alerting mechanisms.<br>- **Expert Human Oversight:** Complex compliance decisions trigger expert human review to balance automation with accountability.<br>- **Predictive Compliance Management:** Utilize predictive analytics to proactively identify emerging compliance and ethical risks. | - *(To finalize…)* |

#### Metrics

- **Percentage (%) of training data validated for bias and quality.**
- **Number of resolved compliance issues or violations.**
- **Percentage (%) of third-party components with complete security assessments.**
