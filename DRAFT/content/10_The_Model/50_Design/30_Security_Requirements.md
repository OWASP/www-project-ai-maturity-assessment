### Security Requirements

The **Security Requirements** practice ensures that AI systems are designed with clear, comprehensive guidelines addressing ethical, legal, and technical risks. Unlike traditional software, AI systems introduce unique challenges, including ethical considerations, compliance with emerging regulations, and vulnerabilities arising from complex data dependencies and model behaviors. Establishing explicit, documented security requirements early in the design phase helps mitigate these risks, supporting responsible innovation and secure AI deployments.

#### Objectives

1. **Risk-Based Requirement Definition**: Define explicit requirements to address ethical, legal, and technical AI risks.
2. **Secure by Design**: Integrate security considerations early in the AI system design lifecycle.
3. **Compliance with regulations**: Ensure compliance with emerging AI regulations and governance standards.
