### User Control and Transparency

User Control and Transparency are essential pillars of responsible AI and digital product design. They ensure users understand how their data is used and have meaningful agency over that use. This maturity model guides organizations in progressing from minimal disclosure to embedded, proactive transparency and user empowerment. It emphasizes both governance structures and practical implementation in design and engineering workflows. The goal is to build trust, comply with regulatory expectations, and respect user autonomy across the product lifecycle.

#### Objectives
1. Provide users with clear, accessible, and timely information about how their data and AI-powered features operate.
2. Enable meaningful user control over data use, personalization, consent, and algorithmic decisions.
3. Establish governance policies that define standards for disclosure, consent, and user engagement.
4. Equip product and engineering teams with design patterns, APIs, and UI components to support transparency and control.
5. Continuously evaluate and improve user-facing transparency mechanisms through metrics and user feedback.

| **Maturity Level** | **Governance & Implementation** | **Design & Engineering Enablement** |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **1 – Initial**<br>User control and transparency mechanisms are limited, inconsistent, or provided only when legally required. | - Disclosures are written in legal terms with limited accessibility.<br>- Consent mechanisms are generic and often bundled.<br>- No clear ownership for transparency or user agency. | - UI elements for control (e.g. toggles, preferences) are ad hoc and hard-coded.<br>- No reusable components or design guidelines for transparency.<br>- Users cannot access or manage their data effectively. |
| **2 – Defined**<br>Policies and workflows are established to standardize user control and disclosure practices. | - A user transparency and control policy is published and enforced.<br>- Roles (e.g., UX Privacy Leads or Product Compliance Liaisons) are assigned.<br>- User consent flows are aligned with legal bases and reviewed periodically. | - Common UI patterns are introduced for preferences, opt-ins/outs, and data visibility.<br>- Consent and disclosure flows are reviewed in design and development phases.<br>- APIs are used to give users access, edit, and delete data consistently. |
| **3 – Optimized**<br>Transparency and user control are embedded by default and continuously improved through feedback and automation. | - User transparency KPIs (e.g. consent clarity, user opt-out rates) are tracked across products.<br>- Real-time consent and preference tracking is integrated with systems.<br>- User-facing explanations are tailored based on context and usage. | - Dynamic UI components adapt transparency and control options based on user needs.<br>- Feedback loops inform design updates based on user behavior and satisfaction.<br>- Privacy dashboards and granular controls are standard in all user-facing systems. |
