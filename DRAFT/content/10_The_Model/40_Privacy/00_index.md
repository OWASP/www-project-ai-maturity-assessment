## Privacy

The **Privacy** pillar addresses the critical need to safeguard personal and sensitive information used by AI systems. AI's dependence on extensive data sets amplifies privacy risks, as data can inadvertently reveal personal details, lead to unauthorized profiling, or be subject to misuse. Proactive privacy management becomes essential, not only for regulatory compliance but also to maintain user trust.

This pillar is structured around three focused practices:

1. **Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation** – Ensuring AI systems collect and process only the data strictly necessary for clearly defined purposes.

2. **Privacy by Design and Default** – Embedding privacy measures deeply within the AI system lifecycle to mitigate risks proactively.

3. **User Control and Transparency** – Providing clear, understandable communication about data use and offering users meaningful controls over their data.
