### Privacy by Design and Default

Privacy by Design and Default (PbD&D) is a foundational principle for building trustworthy and compliant digital systems. This maturity model helps organizations assess and evolve their privacy practices from reactive to proactive implementation. It emphasizes integrating privacy into both governance frameworks and technical workflows. The objective is to ensure privacy is not an afterthought but a core design feature across the entire lifecycle. By progressing through the levels, organizations can move toward automated, measurable, and scalable privacy practices.

#### Objectives

1. **Privacy by Design**: Embed privacy principles into system design and development from the outset, rather than addressing them post-deployment.
2. **Governance and Accountability**: Establish clear roles, policies, and accountability for privacy management across teams and functions.
3. **Enablement through Tools and Patterns**: Equip engineering and design teams with reusable tools, patterns, and frameworks to implement privacy by default.
4. **Pipeline Integration**: Integrate privacy assessments and controls into development pipelines, CI/CD workflows, and governance reviews.
5. **Continuous Privacy Improvement**: Continuously monitor, measure, and improve privacy effectiveness using KPIs and automation.

| **1 – Establish a privacy program** addressing privacy risks and user compliant.                                     | - Privacy risks are addressed post-deployment and handled case-by-case.<br>- No standardized processes for data minimization, DPIAs, or policy application.<br>- Privacy notices and consents are manually generated, often retroactively.              | - Developers and designers operate without privacy design patterns or reusable components.<br>- No standard tools for consent, purpose limitation, or data classification.<br>- Teams depend on personal initiative rather than embedded technical safeguards.                                      |
| **2 – Define a formal privacy program** with well defined privacy practices, policies and assigned responsibilities. | - A Privacy by Design policy is published and adopted organization-wide.<br>- Privacy Officers or Data Stewards are appointed to oversee compliance.<br>- DPIAs and privacy reviews are integrated into product development and procurement lifecycles. | - Privacy design patterns and libraries (e.g., consent modules, data masking APIs) are made available.<br>- Templates and checklists guide teams through privacy requirements in design and development phases.<br>- Teams use shared SDKs for compliant data handling and user control mechanisms. |
| **3 – Continuously improve the Privacy program** with automation and monitoring of key metrics.                      | - DPIAs and approvals are integrated into CI/CD with automated gates.<br>- Data retention, access controls, and minimization are enforced via code.<br>- Privacy KPIs are reviewed quarterly and linked to org-wide OKRs.                               | - Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) like differential privacy and synthetic data are provided by default.<br>- Privacy controls are embedded into design systems and dev workflows.<br>- Metrics on privacy defaults and user control coverage are continuously monitored and improved.         |
