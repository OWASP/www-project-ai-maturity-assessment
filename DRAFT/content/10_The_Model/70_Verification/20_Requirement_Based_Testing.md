### Requirement-based Testing

The AIMA Requirement-based Testing practice ensures AI systems consistently align with defined functional, security, and ethical requirements throughout their lifecycle. By systematically verifying these requirements, organizations ensure reliability, compliance, and ethical integrity of AI deployments, enabling informed and responsible AI use.

#### Objectives

- Verify compliance with functional, security, and ethical standards.
- Maintain clear traceability between requirements and testing activities.
- Continuously improve based on requirement-driven insights.

| Maturity Level | Stream A – Define and Execute Testing | Stream B – Measure and Improve Testing |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **1 – Initial** | - Testing is informal or inconsistently linked to requirements.<br>- Requirement traceability is limited or non-existent.<br>- Testing often reactive rather than planned. | - Minimal or no metrics related to requirement testing.<br>- Testing results documented irregularly.<br>- Limited stakeholder visibility into testing outcomes. |
| **2 – Managed** | - Formal testing process established with clear links to defined requirements.<br>- Responsibility for requirement-based testing clearly assigned.<br>- Regular execution of testing aligned with the AI lifecycle. | - Defined metrics (coverage, requirement compliance rates, defect rates).<br>- Regular reporting of metrics to stakeholders.<br>- Metrics inform decisions and drive continuous improvement. |
| **3 – Optimizing** | - Requirement-based testing fully integrated into continuous development and deployment processes.<br>- Automated and continuous verification against requirements.<br>- Active use of feedback to refine testing and requirement definitions. | - Advanced analytics to continuously track and analyze requirement compliance.<br>- Predictive metrics anticipate issues proactively.<br>- Strong culture of accountability and continuous enhancement driven by detailed, actionable metrics insights. |
