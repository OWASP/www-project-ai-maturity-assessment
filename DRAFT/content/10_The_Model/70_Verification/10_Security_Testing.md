### AIMA Security Testing

The AIMA Security Testing practice is essential for proactively identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in AI systems. By systematically performing specialized security assessments tailored for AI, organizations can strengthen their defense against evolving threats such as adversarial attacks, model poisoning, and robustness failures. These security tests ensure AI systems operate safely, securely, and ethically.

#### Objectives

- Identify vulnerabilities through targeted adversarial testing.
- Ensure resilience against model poisoning and robustness failures.
- Foster continuous improvement in AI security practices based on security insights.

| Maturity Level | Stream A - Conduct Security Assessments | Stream B - Measure and Improve Security |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **1 - Identify the need for establishing a framework** of basic security testing | - Ad hoc security tests with no systematic approach.<br>- Reactive security activities triggered mainly by incidents.<br>- Limited understanding of AI-specific threats. | - No formal security metrics defined or tracked.<br>- Security insights derived primarily from incident response.<br>- Inconsistent or irregular reporting. |
| **2 - Define a proper framework** with defined policies, processes and procedures| - Structured AI security testing approach established (adversarial tests, robustness evaluations).<br>- Defined responsibilities for conducting regular AI security assessments.<br>- AI security activities integrated into broader security testing efforts. | - Defined security metrics (incident frequency, robustness indicators, resilience scores).<br>- Regularly collected and reported security metrics for stakeholder visibility.<br>- Metrics guide security improvements and resource allocation. |
| **3 - Continously Optimize the processes** with monitoring and metrics reporting | - Comprehensive security testing integrated throughout the AI lifecycle.<br>- Advanced threat simulations (continuous adversarial testing, proactive poisoning resistance evaluation).<br>- Dedicated AI security team actively adapting to emerging threats. | - Real-time monitoring and advanced analytics detecting AI-specific security threats.<br>- Predictive metrics forecasting vulnerabilities and proactively addressing them.<br>- Robust, continuous feedback loop driving strategic security enhancements and resource decisions. |
