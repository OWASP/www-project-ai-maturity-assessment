## Verification

The **Verification** pillar addresses the unique challenges of validating and testing AI systems to ensure their security, functionality, and ethical compliance. AI's complex, dynamic behaviors demand specialized verification approaches, ongoing assessments, and rigorous testing processes.

This pillar is structured around three critical practices:

1. **Security Testing** – Conducting specialized assessments of AI systems, including adversarial attacks, robustness testing, and model poisoning resilience.

2. **Requirement-based Testing** – Verifying systematically that AI systems meet defined functional, security, and ethical requirements throughout their lifecycle.

3. **Architecture Assessment** – Regularly reviewing AI system architectures to ensure they conform to best practices, industry standards, and emerging security guidelines.
