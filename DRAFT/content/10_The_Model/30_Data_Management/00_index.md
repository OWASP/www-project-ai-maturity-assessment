## Data Management

The Data Management pillar addresses the unique and critical role that data plays in AI systems. Unlike traditional software, AI relies fundamentally on large datasets not only for operation but also for training and validation. Consequently, the security, quality, and governance of data significantly impact AI system reliability, fairness, and security.

To address these specialized challenges, the Data Management pillar includes three interconnected practices:

- Data Quality and Integrity – Ensuring data accuracy, completeness, reliability, and protection against tampering or corruption, which directly influences AI model performance and security.
- Data Governance and Accountability – Establishing clear ownership, responsibilities, and oversight mechanisms to manage data securely, ethically, and compliantly across its entire lifecycle.
- Data Training – Managing the collection, curation, and use of training datasets securely and responsibly, with explicit attention to bias prevention, data privacy, and traceability.

Together, these practices enable organizations to proactively manage data-driven risks, comply with evolving data regulations, and ensure AI systems operate securely, ethically, and effectively at scale.
