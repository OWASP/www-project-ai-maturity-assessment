### Data Quality and Integrity

In the context of AI readiness, data quality and data integrity are foundational pillars that determine the effectiveness, reliability, and trustworthiness of AI systems. AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. High-quality data ensures that models learn meaningful patterns, produce accurate predictions, and adapt well to changing environments. Integrity safeguards that data remains consistent, accurate, and trustworthy across its lifecycle i.e. from ingestion and processing to storage and consumption. Without robust data quality and integrity practices, organizations risk introducing bias, inaccuracies, compliance violations, and operational inefficiencies into their AI initiatives, ultimately undermining the business value AI is intended to deliver.

Definitions:

1. Data Quality for AI-ready data refers to the degree to which data is accurate, complete, consistent, timely, relevant, and fit for use in training, validating, and deploying AI models.
2. Data Integrity refers to the assurance that data remains authentic, reliable, and unaltered throughout its lifecycle, with robust mechanisms for traceability, auditability, and protection against corruption or unauthorized modifications.

#### Objectives

1. Establish Data Fitness for Advanced AI Systems: Ensure organizational data assets meet the stringent requirements for training, fine-tuning, and operating LLMs and agentic AI systems, including breadth, depth, freshness, and minimal noise or bias.

2. Enable Scalable and Trustworthy AI Deployment: Create a consistent foundation where AI models, including autonomous agents, can safely consume, reason over, and act upon data without human intervention compromising operational integrity.

3. Identify and Prioritize Risk Areas: Detect gaps in data sourcing, governance, and lifecycle management that could expose AI systems to risks such as model drift, data poisoning, decision errors, or compliance failures.



#### Data Management Maturity Model: Data Quality and Data Integrity

| **Maturity Level**              | **Stream A** (Fitness for AI use)                                                                                                                                              | **Stream B** (Trust & Consistency)                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Level 1: Ad Hoc / Initial**    | - Data is siloed, unstructured, and lacks standard definitions.  <br>- High presence of duplicates, missing values, and noise.  <br>- No validation rules for accuracy or relevance. | - No lineage or traceability.  <br>- Data is manually updated with high risk of tampering or corruption.  <br>- Auditability is absent or unreliable.                     |
| **Level 2: Defined / Developing**| - Basic profiling and cleansing implemented.  <br>- Initial completeness and consistency rules applied.  <br>- Data cataloging and metadata tracking begins.                      | - Data lineage partially implemented across core systems.  <br>- Change tracking exists but not automated.  <br>- Some access controls in place, but inconsistently enforced. |
| **Level 3: Managed / Operational**| - - Standardized definitions and metrics for quality dimensions (accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness).- Periodic quality checks across structured/unstructured data.<br>- LLM-specific filters (e.g., toxicity, hallucination-prone data) applied.- Data actively curated based on model feedback, real-time quality scoring, and continuous tracking of bias and representativeness metrics. | - Full lineage and versioning enabled across AI pipelines.- Automated monitoring for integrity violations.<br>- Immutable audit logs, integrated data integrity checkpoints, and active anomaly detection flags for corruption, drift, or unauthorized changes. |

#### Metrics

1. **Data Accuracy Rate**
   - **Type:** Data Quality
   - **Description:** Percentage of data entries that correctly reflect real-world values or events. Essential to ensure that AI models learn from reliable and valid inputs.

2. **Data Freshness / Timeliness**
   - **Type:** Data Quality + Data Integrity
   - **Description:** Measures how current the data is at the time of model training or inference. Crucial for real-time agentic AI and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.

3. **Lineage & Provenance Coverage**
   - **Type:** Data Integrity
   - **Description:** Percentage of datasets with full traceability from source to transformation and usage. Enables trust, auditability, and compliance in AI workflows.

4. **Bias & Representation Score**
   - **Type:** Data Quality
   - **Description:** Quantifies the level of overrepresentation or underrepresentation of different groups or classes in datasets. Helps reduce bias in LLMs and supports responsible AI.

5. **Data Drift / Anomaly Rate**
   - **Type:** Data Integrity + Data Quality
   - **Description:** Frequency at which input data distributions change unexpectedly over time. Critical for detecting model decay and ensuring long-term reliability of AI systems.
