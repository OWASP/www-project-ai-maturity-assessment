### Strategy and Metrics

The Strategy & Metrics practice sits at the foundation of AI-security governance. Its purpose is to make sure the organization knows where it is going with AI security (the strategy) and how it will know it is getting there (the metrics). By defining a clear, business-aligned AI-security strategy and pairing it with objective, repeatable measures of success, leaders gain the insight needed to allocate resources, manage risk, and demonstrate return on investment. Sound strategy keeps AI initiatives pointed toward the organization’s risk appetite and regulatory obligations, while robust metrics turn vague goals into actionable data that drives continuous improvement across the AI lifecycle.

#### Objectives

- Align AI Security Strategy with organizational business goals and risk management.
- Define and Track AI Security Metrics that guide improvements and demonstrate value.
- Ensure Continuous Improvement of AI security practices through iterative reviews.

#### Streams

| Maturity Level | Stream A - Create and Promote | Stream B - Measure and Improve |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **1 - Establish an AI Security and Responsible AI Strategy** aligned with the organization’s overall business goals, ethical standards, and risk profile. | - **Minimal Alignment:** AI security and RAI efforts are not consistently linked to business or ethical goals.<br>- **Unclear Accountability:** No formal ownership for AI security or ethical governance; responsibilities may be scattered.<br>- **Ad Hoc Processes:** AI security actions happen on-demand (e.g., after an incident), with no strategic roadmap. | - **No Formal Metrics:** AI security and RAI outcomes (e.g., incident counts, bias incidents, model validation) are not measured or measured informally.<br>- **Incident-Driven Insights:** Data is gathered primarily after security or ethical incidents with no routine analysis.<br>- **Lack of Standardization:** Reporting varies widely, making organization-wide comparisons difficult. |
| **2 - Define and Track AI Security and RAI Metrics** to measure effectiveness, maturity, fairness, transparency, and return on investment. | - **Documented Strategy:** A formal AI security and RAI strategy exists, referencing relevant enterprise risk, compliance, and ethical needs.<br>- **Clear Governance:** Defined roles (AI Security Lead, AI Ethics Officer, AI Security Committee) ensure accountability, fairness, and decision-making.<br>- **Planned Integration:** AI security and ethical oversight efforts included in project roadmaps, budgets, and organizational planning. | - **Established Metric Set:** KPIs/KRIs (e.g., fairness metrics, model risk classification, explainability standards) tracked over time.<br>- **Regular Collection & Reporting:** Metrics gathered at intervals and shared with stakeholders through dashboards/reports.<br>- **Action-Oriented Insights:** Metrics drive resource allocation, ethical policies, fairness improvements, and actions for regulatory compliance. |
| **3 - Continuously Improve AI Security and RAI Posture** through iterative learning, adaptation, and ethical alignment. | - **Fully Embedded:** AI security and RAI strategy integrated into broader corporate governance and ethics frameworks, continuously updated.<br>- **Executive Sponsorship:** Senior leadership proactively supports AI security and responsible AI as strategic investments.<br>- **Lifecycle Integration:** Mandatory AI security controls (model audits, fairness assessments, transparency measures, human oversight protocols) throughout all AI development and deployment phases. | - **Advanced Analytics & Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of AI systems (data drift, adversarial attack detection, bias detection), automated alerts, and comprehensive audit trails.<br>- **Predictive & Preventive Metrics:** Metrics forecast risks (ethical, security, compliance issues) proactively addressing concerns.<br>- **Culture of Data-Driven and Ethical Governance:** Metrics feed strategic decision-making; clear processes for continuous feedback, fairness enhancements, transparency improvements, and regulatory compliance. |
