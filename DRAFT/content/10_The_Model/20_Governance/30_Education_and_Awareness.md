### Education and Guidance
The **Education & Guidance** practice ensures that everyone who influences an AI system—developers, data scientists, product managers, executives, risk officers, even procurement—understands their security, privacy, and ethical responsibilities. Good intentions alone do not create secure or trustworthy AI; people need the right knowledge, tools, and decision-making frameworks at the right moments. By establishing structured learning paths and feedback loops, organizations embed security-first and responsible-AI thinking into daily work, reducing the likelihood of errors and enabling fast, coordinated responses when new threats or regulations emerge.  

#### Objectives  

1. **Raise AI-Security and Responsible-AI Awareness** across all roles that design, build, deploy, or oversee AI.
2. **Provide Role-Specific Training and Resources** that are actionable, current, and aligned with policy and risk priorities.
3. **Measure Learning Effectiveness and Continuously Improve** curricula, guidance, and tooling based on feedback and emerging challenges.  

#### Streams

| Maturity Level | Stream A – Develop & Deliver Knowledge | Stream B – Evaluate & Sustain Competence |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **1 – Establish Baseline AI-Security and RAI Awareness** for anyone touching AI initiatives. | - **Ad-Hoc Learning:** Security and ethics topics appear sporadically in general tech training or after incidents.<br/>- **Limited Reach:** Only core engineering teams receive any AI-security guidance; business and risk stakeholders rarely included.<br/>- **Informal Materials:** Slide decks or wiki pages exist but are not curated or kept up to date. | - **No Formal Measurement:** Completion rates, quiz scores, or adoption of guidance are not tracked.<br/>- **Reactive Improvements:** Content is updated only when major issues arise.<br/>- **Knowledge Gaps Unidentified:** The organization lacks insight into which roles need deeper AI-security skills. |
| **2 – Provide Structured, Role-Based AI-Security and RAI Training** aligned with policies and risk appetite. | - **Documented Curriculum:** Mandatory courses cover AI-specific threats, privacy, bias, and incident response; electives address deeper topics like adversarial ML or model interpretability.<br/>- **Role Tailoring:** Distinct learning paths for developers, data scientists, product owners, and executives.<br/>- **Guidance Library:** Curated playbooks, checklists, and coding examples are integrated into day-to-day tools (e.g., notebooks, IDE extensions). | - **Tracked Participation & Assessments:** Learning-management system tracks completion, scores, and certifications.<br/>- **Feedback Loops:** Learners rate relevance; course owners revise based on survey data and policy updates.<br/>- **Skill Gap Analysis:** Regular reviews map workforce skills to upcoming AI projects and risk areas. |
| **3 – Embed Continuous, Data-Driven Learning Culture** that adapts to evolving AI threats and regulations. | - **Just-In-Time Micro-Learning:** Contextual tips and secure-by-design snippets appear in pipelines, notebooks, and code reviews.<br/>- **Community & Mentorship:** Internal forums, guilds, and brown-bag sessions foster knowledge sharing; external conferences encouraged.<br/>- **Automated Guidance Updates:** New threat intel or policy changes automatically trigger content refresh and notification to affected roles. | - **Performance-Linked Metrics:** Training impact measured through defect density, incident trends, and model audit scores.<br/>- **Adaptive Curriculum:** AI identifies learning gaps and personalizes content sequences.<br/>- **Benchmarking & Recognition:** Organization compares learning maturity against industry, offers badges or career incentives, and publicly shares best practices to demonstrate leadership. |
