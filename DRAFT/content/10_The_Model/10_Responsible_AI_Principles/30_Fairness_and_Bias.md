### Fairness and Bias

Fairness and bias practices make sure everyone involved in AI work - designers, developers, deployers, and the people making rules - actively tries to spot and fix unwanted biases in data, algorithms and results. Technical fixes like debiasing algorithms and fairness metrics matter but aren't enough on their own. We need organizational structures too - clear roles, policies and ways to learn - that turn ethical AI principles into everyday decisions. AI systems learn biases from historical data, algorithm choices, and human oversight. If we don't watch for these biases, they can keep discrimination going in hiring, lending, healthcare and more areas. A good fairness practice that grows over time combines awareness, defining requirements, using tools for assessment, and constant feedback to build responsible-AI thinking and systems that can handle problems.

#### Objectives

1. Raise Organization-Wide Fairness Awareness--Ensure that developers, data scientists, product managers, executives, and procurement teams understand common bias sources (data imbalance, label bias, proxy variables) and the business, legal, and reputational risks they pose.

2. Define Role-Specific Fairness Requirements--Document clear fairness criteria for each role: data stewards must perform representativeness checks; modelers must run statistical parity and equalized odds tests; product owners must evaluate user-impact scenarios and disparate outcomes.

3. Embed Standardized Assessment Toolkits--Roll out open-source frameworks and explainability libraries into CI/CD pipelines to automate bias detection and reporting at key development milestones.

4. Establish Fairness Governance Forums--Convene cross-functional councils—including legal, ethics, UX, and impacted community representatives—to review high-risk models, adjudicate trade-offs, and approve remediation plans before production deployment .

5. Measure & Iterate on Fairness Outcomes--Track fairness KPIs (e.g., demographic parity difference, false positive/negative rate gaps) through dashboards; conduct regular bias audits and red-teaming exercises to surface emergent issues, then refine policies, training, and tooling accordingly

| **1 - Establish adhoc approach** to respond to requests towards Fairness and bias  | - **Ad Hoc Response:** Bias addressed inconsistently, primarily after complaints or incidents.<br>- **Unclear Roles:** Responsibilities assigned informally, without defined roles or documented processes.<br>- **Lack of Tools:** No standardized tools, checkpoints, or processes established for bias assessment.                                                     | - **Limited Awareness:** Cultural awareness driven by individual initiative without formal training.<br>- **Informal Reporting:** Reporting of bias concerns voluntary and unstructured; insights not consistently acted upon.<br>- **No Defined Metrics:** Absence of formal metrics or tracking methods for bias-related issues.                                                         |
| **2 - Define structured Implementation** with formalized policies and processes, but limited integration.                         | - **Defined Policies:** Formal policies, charters, and governance forums guide bias mitigation efforts.<br>- **Tool Integration:** Fairness assessment tools and documentation used at key project milestones.<br>- **Regular Assessments:** Regular bias evaluations conducted but not always tied explicitly to KPIs or business outcomes.                              | - **Role-Specific Training:** Regular fairness training tailored to specific roles.<br>- **Feedback Mechanisms:** Project retrospectives and knowledge sharing occur regularly post-release.<br>- **Partial Engagement:** Cultural engagement and fairness awareness present but inconsistently applied organization-wide.                                                                 |
