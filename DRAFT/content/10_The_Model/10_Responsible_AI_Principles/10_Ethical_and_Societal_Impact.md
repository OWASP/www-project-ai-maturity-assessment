### Ethical Values and Societal Impact
Ethical values are fundamental in the design, development and implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. As AI technologies increasingly influence various aspects of society and the world we live in, it is critical to ensure that these systems are in line with ethical values such as the centrality of the Human Being, the Well-Being of the Human Being, respect for Human Rights, compliance with the Law, respect for the Environment.
Addressing these issues involves proactively identifying and mitigating potential negative impacts to human beings and the environment. By incorporating ethical considerations into AI practices, organizations can build stakeholder trust, comply with regulatory requirements, and contribute positively to the communities and world in which we live.


#### Objectives

1. Promote Human-Centric: AI must be conceived, designed, developed and used as a tool to serve the human being.
2. Support Human Well-Being: AI's ultimate goal is the improvement of Human well-being.
3. Safeguard Fundamental Rights: AI must always respect, protect and promote the rights of the human being, as a person and as a community.
4. Ensure Rule of Law: AI must always comply with existing and applicable laws and regulations.
5. Secure Environmental Protection: AI must promote environmental sustainability and the well-being of ecosystems throughout their life cycle.
6. Encourage Stakeholder Engagement: Involve diverse stakeholders in the design, development and evaluation of AI systems to reflect a broad range of perspectives and values.
