### Secure Build

#### Objectives
Establish secure integration of AI/LLM components by promoting responsible sourcing, secure coding, resilient design, and defensible supply chain choices.

## AI Model Inventory Maturity Levels

| **Maturity Level & Description** | **Stream A – Process-Oriented** | **Stream B – Technical Controls** |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Level 1 – Establish awareness** with Governance and controls for foundation framework implementation. | - Model sources selected without standard criteria. <br> - Inventory is informal or outdated. <br> - Purpose and provenance of models are rarely documented. | - License terms and dependencies rarely verified. <br> - Known vulnerabilities not consistently scanned. <br> - No formal toolchain for validation. |
| **Level 2 – Defined Practices** with security and governance practices are being documented and implemented. | - Secure development guidelines include AI-specific considerations. <br> - Model reviews include basic ethical and compliance checks. <br> - Inventory management is standardized but not automated. | - Input/output sanitization in place. <br> - Models and datasets version-controlled. <br> - Basic output validation initiated. |
| **Level 3 – Continously Manage Risk** with proactive governance and supply chain-level awareness. | - Formal risk assessments conducted for third-party and internal models. <br> - Custody of AI assets is tracked and managed. <br> - Attestations and compliance documents are requested from providers. | - Adversarial testing is routinely performed. <br> - AI checks are integrated into CI/CD pipelines. <br> - Behavior under edge cases is validated. |
