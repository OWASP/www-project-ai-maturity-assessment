### Secure Deployment

Secure deployment of AI requires organizations to recognize that models do not behave as static software artifacts but evolve over time. Therefore, deployment strategies must account for model drift, environmental changes, and real-world adversarial conditions. Continuous operational monitoring and governance are vital to ensure that deployed AI systems remain effective, fair, and secure throughout their lifecycle.

#### Objectives


- **Establish clear documentation and traceability** for AI model configurations, environments, and runtime dependencies to support operational visibility.

- **Implement structured approval workflows and rollback procedures** to ensure safe, auditable, and accountable AI deployments.

- **Secure deployed AI assets** by enforcing access controls, logging access events, and encrypting sensitive model data.

- **Integrate legal and regulatory compliance into deployment pipelines** through automated checks and continuous documentation readiness.

- **Enhance resilience and reliability** by detecting model drift, monitoring for hallucinations, and triggering real-time alerts during high-risk behavior.



## ðŸš€ AI Deployment Governance Maturity Levels

| **Maturity Level & Description** | **Stream A â€“ Process-Oriented** | **Stream B â€“ Technical Controls** |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Level 1 â€“ Foundational Deployment Practices** <br> Initial efforts focus on basic documentation and monitoring. | **Environment Capture:** Document deployment configurations and runtime environments. <br> **Dependency Logging:** Record libraries, dependencies, and versions. <br> **Manual Tracking:** Maintain basic records without automation. | **Basic Monitoring:** Track model performance over time. <br> **I/O Logging:** Log inputs and outputs for traceability. <br> **Usage Metrics:** Collect simple metrics (e.g., invocation count, latency). |
| **Level 2 â€“ Structured Deployment Governance** <br> Deployment is governed by formal processes and access protections. | **Approval Workflows:** Define clear steps for review and sign-off before deployment. <br> **Rollback Plans:** Establish mechanisms to revert to a prior version safely. <br> **Audit Trails:** Log and store deployment decisions for traceability. | **Access Restrictions:** Implement role-based access control for deployed models. <br> **Access Logging:** Record and monitor access to model endpoints. <br> **Encryption:** Secure model artifacts and sensitive data at rest. |
| **Level 3 â€“ Proactive and Compliant Operations** <br> Continuous compliance and resilience mechanisms are integrated into operations. | **Compliance Checks:** Regularly assess for legal, regulatory, and policy alignment. <br> **Automation:** Integrate compliance checks into CI/CD workflows. <br> **Audit Readiness:** Maintain documentation for regulatory or internal audits. | **Resilience Design:** Build fallbacks or safe shutdown options. <br> **Drift Detection:** Monitor models for data or performance drift. <br> **Alerting Systems:** Trigger real-time alerts for hallucinations or anomalies. |
