### Event Management

Event Management involves structured detection, response, and learning processes for anomalies, failures, and deviations in AI systems. Effective Event Management ensures that incidents related to model behavior, infrastructure, or data flow are rapidly identified, thoroughly investigated, transparently documented, and leveraged for continuous improvement.

#### Objective

* **Real-Time Detection:** Quickly identify model drift, unfair predictions, infrastructure failures, and compliance violations.
* **Structured Response:** Implement standardized procedures for incident handling and resolution.
* **Transparency and Accountability:** Maintain thorough records and audit trails for all AI-related incidents.
* **Continuous Learning:** Utilize incident insights to enhance models, processes, and deployment safeguards.
* **Minimize Impact:** Limit business disruptions and reputational risks resulting from AI system issues.

#### Streams

| Maturity Level | Stream A – Detection & Alerting                          | Stream B – Response & Continuous Learning                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Level 1: Establish Basic Monitoring**and Ad Hoc Response Capabilities to detect issues manually and react without formal processes. | **Manual Detection**<br>- Events are identified manually, often after impact is observed.<br>**No Anomaly Detection**<br>- No structured methods for identifying drift, outliers, or degradation.<br>**Reactive Approach**<br>- Monitoring is not proactive or automated. | **Ad Hoc Management**<br>- Incidents are handled reactively without structured processes.<br>**No Documentation**<br>- Incidents are rarely logged or reviewed systematically.<br>**Lack of Learning**<br>- No mechanisms in place for organizational learning from incidents. |
| **Level 2: Develop Structured Monitoring** and Initial Learning Mechanisms to track key metrics, detect anomalies, and analyze incidents. | **Basic Monitoring**<br>- Latency, availability, and accuracy metrics are tracked.<br>**Initial Anomaly Detection**<br>- Basic drift and outlier detection introduced.<br>**Alerting Setup**<br>- Manual or threshold-based alerting in place. | **Incident Logging**<br>- Incidents are logged and tracked manually.<br>**Occasional RCA**<br>- Root cause analysis is performed inconsistently.<br>**Partial Documentation**<br>- Some lessons learned are captured but not systematized. |
| **Level 3: Achieve Proactive, Intelligent Monitoring and Continuous Learning** by automating detection and integrating improvements from incident insights. | **Real-Time Monitoring**<br>- Continuous monitoring with dashboards and alerting tools.<br>**ML-Driven Detection**<br>- Advanced analytics and machine learning detect anomalies and drift proactively.<br>**Proactive Alerts**<br>- Intelligent alerting reduces false positives and accelerates response. | **Comprehensive Workflows**<br>- Formal incident response workflows across teams.<br>**Systematic RCA**<br>- Structured root cause analysis feeds into quality improvements.<br>**Continuous Learning Loop**<br>- Learnings are documented, shared, and integrated into system design. |
