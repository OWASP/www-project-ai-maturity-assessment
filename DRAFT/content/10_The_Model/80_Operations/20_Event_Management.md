### Event Management

Event Management involves structured detection, response, and learning processes for anomalies, failures, and deviations in AI systems. Effective Event Management ensures that incidents related to model behavior, infrastructure, or data flow are rapidly identified, thoroughly investigated, transparently documented, and leveraged for continuous improvement.

#### Objective

* **Real-Time Detection:** Quickly identify model drift, unfair predictions, infrastructure failures, and compliance violations.
* **Structured Response:** Implement standardized procedures for incident handling and resolution.
* **Transparency and Accountability:** Maintain thorough records and audit trails for all AI-related incidents.
* **Continuous Learning:** Utilize incident insights to enhance models, processes, and deployment safeguards.
* **Minimize Impact:** Limit business disruptions and reputational risks resulting from AI system issues.

#### Streams

| Maturity Level       | Stream A – Detection & Alerting                                                                                                     | Stream B – Response & Continuous Learning                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 – Foundational** | - Manual detection of incidents.<br>- No structured anomaly detection.                                                              | - Ad hoc incident management.<br>- No formal documentation or learning processes.                                                         |
| **2 – Developing**   | - Basic monitoring and alerting for latency, availability, and accuracy.<br>- Initial drift and anomaly detection.                  | - Incidents logged and manually analyzed.<br>- Occasional root cause analysis and documentation.                                          |
| **3 – Mature**       | - Real-time monitoring with advanced analytics and ML-driven detection mechanisms.<br>- Proactive anomaly and drift identification. | - Comprehensive incident management workflows.<br>- Systematic root cause analysis, documentation, and proactive improvement integration. |
