### Operational Management

Operational Management encompasses processes and practices aimed at maintaining consistent, reliable, and secure AI system operations. Effective Operational Management ensures that AI systems perform optimally, securely, and continuously meet compliance and business objectives.

#### Objective

1. **Operational Stability:** Maintain reliable and consistent performance of AI systems.
2. **Security Compliance:** Ensure operations adhere to established security standards and compliance requirements.
3. **Effective Resource Management:** Optimize resource allocation and usage to sustain system performance and efficiency.
4. **Proactive Maintenance:** Implement regular maintenance schedules to prevent operational disruptions and maintain system health.
5. **Adaptability and Scalability:** Manage operations flexibly to accommodate changes, updates, and scalability requirements.

#### Streams

| Maturity Level | Stream A – System Monitoring & Maintenance | Stream B – Security & Compliance Management |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **1- Early-stage capabilities** with initial monitoring, basic controls, and emerging awareness. | **Manual Monitoring**<br>- Monitoring is ad hoc or manual, lacking structured visibility into system health.<br>**Reactive Maintenance**<br>- Maintenance occurs only after failures or disruptions.<br>**Limited Coverage**<br>- No proactive checks or resource planning in place. | **Basic Compliance Awareness**<br>- Security and compliance concepts are understood but not formalized.<br>**Ad Hoc Checks**<br>- Security reviews are sporadic and undocumented.<br>**Minimal Documentation**<br>- Few written procedures or audit trails exist. |
| **2-Developing structured** processes and growing automation foster improved reliability and accountability. | **Scheduled Monitoring**<br>- Regular system health checks and performance metrics are collected.<br>**Preventive Maintenance**<br>- Maintenance activities are performed on a routine schedule.<br>**Improved Stability**<br>- Operational disruptions are reduced due to consistent upkeep. | **Standardized Security Practices**<br>- Security controls are documented and partially automated.<br>**Regular Audits**<br>- Periodic audits and compliance checks are initiated.<br>**Policy Alignment**<br>- Processes begin aligning with regulatory and organizational requirements. |
| **3-Mature advanced systems** driving resilience, compliance, and continuous performance improvement. | **Automated Monitoring**<br>- Real-time, automated alerts with predictive performance and failure analysis.<br>**Continuous Optimization**<br>- Systems are tuned continuously for uptime and efficiency.<br>**Proactive Resource Management**<br>- Resource scaling and tuning are managed through automated tools. | **Automated Compliance Enforcement**<br>- Continuous compliance monitoring is fully automated.<br>**Integrated Security Audits**<br>- Routine, detailed security audits with full traceability.<br>**Proactive Threat Mitigation**<br>- Threat detection and response are integrated into daily operations. |
