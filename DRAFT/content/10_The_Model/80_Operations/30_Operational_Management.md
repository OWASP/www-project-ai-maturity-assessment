* **Proactive Maintenance:** Implement regular maintenance schedules to prevent operational disruptions and maintain system health.
* **Adaptability and Scalability:** Manage operations flexibly to accommodate changes, updates, and scalability requirements.

#### Streams

| Maturity Level       | Stream A – System Monitoring & Maintenance                                                                                                                  | Stream B – Security & Compliance Management                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 – Foundational** | - Minimal or manual monitoring practices.<br>- Reactive maintenance without regular scheduling.                                                             | - Basic compliance awareness with limited structured procedures.<br>- Ad-hoc security checks and minimal documentation.                                                |
| **2 – Developing**   | - Scheduled system checks and performance monitoring implemented.<br>- Regular maintenance activities initiated to prevent major disruptions.               | - Standard security practices documented and partially automated.<br>- Regular audits and compliance checks initiated.                                                 |
| **3 – Mature**       | - Comprehensive monitoring with automated alerting and predictive maintenance strategies.<br>- Continuous performance optimization and resource management. | - Fully automated compliance monitoring and enforcement.<br>- Detailed security audits, reporting, and proactive threat mitigation integrated into routine operations. |
