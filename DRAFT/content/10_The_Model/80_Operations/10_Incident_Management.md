### Incident Management

Incident Management within AI systems is essential for promptly addressing security breaches, unexpected behaviors, or system failures. AI systems, including machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs), introduce unique challenges like adversarial attacks, model manipulation, and emergent biases. Traditional incident management approaches may not sufficiently address these complexities. Effective Incident Management ensures security, reliability, and ethical alignment throughout the AI system lifecycle.

#### Objective

* **Swift Detection and Containment:** Rapidly identify and contain vulnerabilities and incidents.
* **Root Cause Analysis and Mitigation:** Investigate incidents thoroughly and implement measures to prevent recurrence.
* **Transparent Communication and Reporting:** Maintain clear and timely communication with stakeholders, regulators, and users.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Use insights from incidents to enhance security protocols and improve response strategies.

| **1 – Initial**  | - Basic incident detection with reactive responses.<br>- Limited formal processes for incident containment.                                       | - Informal reporting with minimal stakeholder communication.<br>- Limited or ad-hoc post-incident reviews.                                                            |
| **2 – Managed**  | - Established protocols for detection, containment, and initial analysis.<br>- Defined roles and responsibilities within incident response teams. | - Structured communication protocols for key stakeholders.<br>- Regular post-incident reviews with documented outcomes.                                               |
| **3 – Advanced** | - Automated detection systems leveraging real-time analytics.<br>- Comprehensive forensic analysis integrated into response workflows.            | - Proactive stakeholder notifications and detailed incident reporting.<br>- Continuous improvement integrated systematically based on incidents and emerging threats. |
