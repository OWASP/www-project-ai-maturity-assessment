### Incident Management

Incident Management within AI systems is essential for promptly addressing security breaches, unexpected behaviors, or system failures. AI systems, including machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs), introduce unique challenges like adversarial attacks, model manipulation, and emergent biases. Traditional incident management approaches may not sufficiently address these complexities. Effective Incident Management ensures security, reliability, and ethical alignment throughout the AI system lifecycle.

#### Objective

1. **Swift Detection and Containment:** Rapidly identify and contain vulnerabilities and incidents.
2. **Root Cause Analysis and Mitigation:** Investigate incidents thoroughly and implement measures to prevent recurrence.
3. **Transparent Communication and Reporting:** Maintain clear and timely communication with stakeholders, regulators, and users.
4. **Continuous Improvement:** Use insights from incidents to enhance security protocols and improve response strategies.

#### Streams

| Maturity Level | Stream A – Incident Response and Analysis            | Stream B – Continuous Improvement and Reporting           |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1: Establish Initial AI Incident Detection and Basic Response Capabilities** | **Reactive Detection**<br>- Basic incident detection with reactive responses.<br>**Ad Hoc Containment**<br>- Limited formal processes for incident containment.<br>**Minimal Analysis**<br>- Initial triage without deep forensic investigation. | **Informal Reporting**<br>- Incident reporting is informal with minimal stakeholder communication.<br>**Limited Communication**<br>- Stakeholder engagement is minimal or ad-hoc.<br>**Sparse Post-Incident Review**<br>- Post-incident reviews are limited or informal. |
| **2: Manage and Standardize AI Incident Handling and Post-Incident Evaluation** | **Standardized Protocols**<br>- Established protocols for detection, containment, and initial analysis.<br>**Defined Roles**<br>- Clear roles and responsibilities in incident response teams.<br>**Consistent Workflows**<br>- Repeatable incident handling processes. | **Structured Communication**<br>- Formal communication protocols with key stakeholders.<br>**Regular Reviews**<br>- Scheduled post-incident reviews with documented outcomes.<br>**Tracked Improvements**<br>- Outcomes and lessons learned are documented and tracked. |
