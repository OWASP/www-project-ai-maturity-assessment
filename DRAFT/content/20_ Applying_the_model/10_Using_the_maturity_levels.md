# Using the AIMA Maturity Levels

The OWASP AI Maturity Assessment (AIMA) model builds on OWASP SAMM’s approach, defining three **maturity levels** for each practice in the 8 Business Functions domains with detailed components. The AIMA Business Functions are described in the chapter above: Responsible AI Principles, Governance, Data Management, Privacy, Design, Implementation, Verification and Operation.

Each Security Practices inside at each of the 8 Business Functions is described in terms of the following components:

* **Objective:** A general goal statement that captures the assurance aim of achieving that level for the AI governance practice. As levels increase, the objectives become more sophisticated in terms of establishing robust, responsible AI practices within the organization. In other words, each level’s objective articulates the higher-level outcome (e.g. basic AI governance established at Level 1, a comprehensive AI strategy with metrics by Level 2, continuous improvement and optimization by Level 3).

* **Activities:** The core requisites or activities that must be performed to attain the level. Some activities are organization-wide (e.g. establishing an AI oversight committee or policy), while others may be project-specific (e.g. conducting risk assessments for each AI project). These activities capture the essential *AI governance functions*, but teams have flexibility in how they implement them. For example, a Level 1 activity in **Strategy & Metrics** might be *defining an initial AI strategy document*, whereas by Level 2 activities could include *implementing metrics tracking for AI system performance and risk*.

* **Results:** The capabilities or deliverables obtained by achieving the level. Results could be concrete artifacts or processes (such as an AI risk register, compliance reports, training programs) or qualitative improvements in capacity. For instance, a Level 1 result in **Policy & Compliance** may simply be *awareness of legal requirements*, while a Level 2 result might be *established AI policies and periodic compliance audits*, and Level 3 could yield *fully integrated compliance evidence management and continuous monitoring*.

In the next chapter we will describe how to perform the assement using the AIMA Model in order to evaluate the maturity of the target Company.
