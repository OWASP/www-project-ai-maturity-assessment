## Responsible AI Principles Assessment Worksheet for AIMA

Below is a sample **Responsible AI Principles domain assessment worksheet** for AIMA. It is organized by practice (Fairness & Bias, Transparency & Explainability, Ethical & Societal Impact) and grouped by maturity level. For each question, an assessor would mark **Yes or No** to indicate whether the organization currently fulfills that criterion. Achieving all “Yes” answers in Level 1 for a given practice indicates maturity Level 1 is attained; all Level 1 and Level 2 “Yes” indicates Level 2, and so on. (Partial “Yes” in the next level would be noted as a “+” as discussed.)

#### Fairness & Bias – Ensuring AI systems operate without unfair discrimination.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Bias Identification and Assessment                                                       | Stream B: Bias Mitigation Strategies                                                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1        | Is there initial awareness and informal identification of potential biases in AI systems?          | Are any informal or ad hoc bias mitigation steps currently in place?                         |
| Level 2        | Are systematic procedures established to regularly identify and assess biases in AI models?        | Are defined mitigation strategies implemented and periodically reviewed?                     |
| Level 3        | Is bias assessment integrated systematically across all AI lifecycle stages and audited regularly? | Are proactive mitigation practices continuously monitored and refined across AI deployments? |

#### Transparency & Explainability – Providing understandable explanations of AI systems.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Explainability Mechanisms                                                               | Stream B: Transparency Reporting and Communication                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1        | Are there informal efforts to explain AI outputs or decisions when requested?                     | Is communication about AI systems’ workings sporadic or reactive?                       |
| Level 2        | Are formal explainability mechanisms in place for critical AI models or systems?                  | Are transparency and explanations regularly documented and shared internally?           |
| Level 3        | Are advanced, comprehensive explainability techniques consistently applied across all AI systems? | Is there proactive external reporting and open communication regarding AI transparency? |

#### Ethical & Societal Impact – Assessing and managing broader impacts of AI systems.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Impact Assessment Procedures                                                                     | Stream B: Ethical Decision-Making Framework                                                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1        | Is there informal awareness of the potential ethical and societal impacts of AI systems?                   | Are ethical considerations occasionally discussed in an informal manner?                                                   |
| Level 2        | Have formal processes been established to assess AI's ethical and societal impacts?                        | Is there an established framework guiding ethical decision-making for AI systems?                                          |
| Level 3        | Are impact assessments systematically integrated into all AI projects, continuously reviewed, and updated? | Is ethical decision-making fully embedded in organizational processes, consistently guiding AI development and deployment? |
