## Verification Assessment Worksheet

Below is a sample **Verification domain assessment worksheet** for AIMA. It is organized by practice (Security Testing, Requirement-Based Testing, Architecture Assessment) and grouped by maturity level. For each question, an assessor would mark **Yes or No** to indicate whether the organization currently fulfills that criterion. Achieving all “Yes” answers in Level 1 for a given practice indicates maturity Level 1 is attained; all Level 1 and Level 2 “Yes” indicates Level 2, and so on. (Partial “Yes” in the next level would be noted as a “+” as discussed.)

#### Security Testing – Validating AI systems through systematic security testing.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Conduct Security Assessments                                                               | Stream B: Measure and Improve Security                                                           |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Level 1        | Are basic security assessments occasionally conducted informally on AI systems?                      | Is there informal measurement and basic improvement of security practices?                       |
| Level 2        | Is there a systematic approach documented for conducting regular security assessments on AI systems? | Are security practices measured consistently, with improvements periodically implemented?        |
| Level 3        | Are security assessments fully integrated, regularly performed, and subject to ongoing refinement?   | Are security metrics comprehensively used to drive continuous improvement and regularly audited? |

#### Requirement-Based Testing – Ensuring AI systems meet defined functional and security requirements.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Define and Execute Testing                                                         | Stream B: Measure and Improve Testing                                                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1        | Are basic requirement-based tests occasionally conducted informally?                         | Is requirement verification informally performed with occasional improvements?          |
| Level 2        | Is there a systematic, documented approach for requirement-based testing regularly applied?  | Is the effectiveness of requirements verification regularly measured and improved?      |
| Level 3        | Is requirement-based testing fully integrated, regularly executed, and continuously refined? | Is requirements verification proactively validated, improved, and consistently audited? |

#### Architecture Assessment – Assessing AI system architectures for security and compliance.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Conduct Architecture Reviews                                                     | Stream B: Measure and Improve Architecture                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1        | Are basic architecture reviews occasionally conducted informally on AI systems?            | Is architecture improvement informally measured and occasionally addressed?                       |
| Level 2        | Is there a systematic and documented approach for conducting regular architecture reviews? | Are architectural effectiveness and compliance regularly measured and improvements implemented?   |
| Level 3        | Are architecture reviews fully integrated, regularly executed, and continuously refined?   | Is architectural effectiveness proactively managed, continuously measured, and regularly audited? |
