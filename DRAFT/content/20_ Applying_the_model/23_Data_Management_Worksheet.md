## Data Management Assessment Worksheet for AIMA

Below is a sample **Data Management domain assessment worksheet** for AIMA. It is organized by practice (Data Quality & Integrity, Data Governance & Accountability, Data Training) and grouped by maturity level. For each question, an assessor would mark **Yes or No** to indicate whether the organization currently fulfills that criterion. Achieving all “Yes” answers in Level 1 for a given practice indicates maturity Level 1 is attained; all Level 1 and Level 2 “Yes” indicates Level 2, and so on. (Partial “Yes” in the next level would be noted as a “+” as discussed.)

#### Data Quality & Integrity – Ensuring AI data is accurate, reliable, and consistent.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Quality Assurance Procedures                                                       | Stream B: Data Integrity Controls                                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1        | Are there informal or ad hoc processes to ensure basic data quality?                         | Are initial integrity checks occasionally performed on data?                           |
| Level 2        | Are formalized data quality procedures defined and regularly executed?                       | Are consistent data integrity controls systematically applied and reviewed?            |
| Level 3        | Is data quality management embedded throughout the data lifecycle and continuously improved? | Are advanced integrity controls proactively monitored and refined across all datasets? |

#### Data Governance & Accountability – Managing data responsibly and transparently.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Data Governance Structures                                                                               | Stream B: Accountability and Compliance Monitoring                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1        | Is there initial awareness or informal processes in place for data governance?                                     | Are basic accountability measures occasionally discussed informally?                    |
| Level 2        | Are formal governance structures and responsibilities clearly defined and communicated?                            | Are accountability and compliance regularly reviewed through structured assessments?    |
| Level 3        | Is data governance systematically integrated into organizational operations, continuously reviewed, and optimized? | Is comprehensive accountability proactively managed, regularly audited, and documented? |

#### Data Training – Managing and Monitoring AI training datasets.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Dataset Management (Accuracy, Consistency, Curation)                                      | Stream B: Monitoring & Compliance (Security, Licensing, Ethical Use)                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Level 1        | Is training data gathered informally, with minimal consistency or curation standards?               | Are there minimal or no compliance checks for third-party data usage?                                                |
| Level 2        | Are standardized processes for dataset collection and labeling formally defined?                    | Are compliance and ethical standards regularly reviewed for external datasets?                                       |
| Level 3        | Is data preparation fully automated, consistently maintained, and regularly evaluated and adjusted? | Is monitoring of datasets for security, licensing, and ethical use systematically implemented and regularly audited? |
