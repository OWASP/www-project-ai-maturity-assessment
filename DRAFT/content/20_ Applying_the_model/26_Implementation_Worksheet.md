## Implementation Assessment Worksheet for AIMA

Below is a sample **Implementation domain assessment worksheet** for AIMA. It is organized by practice (Secure Build, Secure Deployment, Defect Management) and grouped by maturity level. For each question, an assessor would mark **Yes or No** to indicate whether the organization currently fulfills that criterion. Achieving all “Yes” answers in Level 1 for a given practice indicates maturity Level 1 is attained; all Level 1 and Level 2 “Yes” indicates Level 2, and so on. (Partial “Yes” in the next level would be noted as a “+” as discussed.)

#### Secure Build – Ensuring AI systems are securely built.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Process-Oriented                                                                    | Stream B: Technical Controls                                                                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1        | Are there basic informal practices for secure building of AI systems?                         | Is security tooling or automation occasionally used in the build process?                          |
| Level 2        | Are formal, systematic build security procedures documented and consistently applied?         | Is security tooling regularly integrated into the build pipeline?                                  |
| Level 3        | Is secure build methodology fully integrated, continuously monitored, and regularly improved? | Are advanced tooling and automation fully embedded and continuously enhanced in the build process? |

#### Secure Deployment – Deploying AI systems securely.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Process-Oriented                                                                         | Stream B: Technical Controls                                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1        | Are there informal or ad hoc processes for securely deploying AI systems?                          | Are basic technical controls occasionally implemented during deployment?           |
| Level 2        | Are formal processes defined and consistently followed for secure deployment of AI systems?        | Are standard technical controls systematically implemented and regularly reviewed? |
| Level 3        | Is secure deployment methodology fully integrated, continuously monitored, and regularly improved? | Are advanced technical controls proactively managed and audited during deployment? |

#### Defect Management – Identifying, tracking, and resolving defects in AI systems.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Process-Oriented                                                                     | Stream B: Technical Controls                                                                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1        | Are defect tracking processes informally applied or inconsistently documented?                 | Are basic technical methods occasionally used to identify and resolve defects?                 |
| Level 2        | Are defect tracking processes systematically implemented and regularly documented?             | Are technical methods consistently applied and regularly reviewed to manage defects?           |
| Level 3        | Are defect tracking processes fully integrated, proactively managed, and continuously refined? | Are advanced technical controls fully embedded and continuously enhanced in defect management? |
