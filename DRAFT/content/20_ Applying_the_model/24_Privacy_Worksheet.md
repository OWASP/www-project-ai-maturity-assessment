## Privacy Assessment Worksheet for AIMA

Below is a sample **Privacy domain assessment worksheet** for AIMA. It is organized by practice (Data Minimization & Purpose Limitation, Privacy by Design & Default, User Control & Transparency) and grouped by maturity level. For each question, an assessor would mark **Yes or No** to indicate whether the organization currently fulfills that criterion. Achieving all “Yes” answers in Level 1 for a given practice indicates maturity Level 1 is attained; all Level 1 and Level 2 “Yes” indicates Level 2, and so on. (Partial “Yes” in the next level would be noted as a “+” as discussed.)

#### Data Minimization & Purpose Limitation – Ensuring AI collects only necessary data for explicit purposes.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Data Minimization Practices                                                           | Stream B: Purpose Limitation Controls                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1        | Is there basic awareness and informal processes around data minimization?                       | Are data collection purposes informally discussed or inconsistently documented? |
| Level 2        | Are formal procedures established to regularly review and minimize data collection?             | Are explicit purposes clearly defined, communicated, and regularly reviewed?    |
| Level 3        | Is data minimization proactively embedded into data collection practices across all operations? | Are stringent purpose limitation controls systematically enforced and audited?  |

#### Privacy by Design & Default – Integrating privacy considerations throughout AI system development.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Privacy by Design Procedures                                                      | Stream B: Default Privacy Settings and Controls                                       |
| -------------- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1        | Is there initial awareness or informal consideration of privacy aspects during AI design?   | Are default privacy settings informally considered in AI systems?                     |
| Level 2        | Are formal privacy by design procedures integrated into AI development processes?           | Are default privacy controls systematically implemented and documented?               |
| Level 3        | Is privacy by design fully embedded and iteratively refined across the entire AI lifecycle? | Are comprehensive default privacy settings proactively managed and regularly audited? |

#### User Control & Transparency – Empowering users with clear information and control over their data.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: User Transparency Mechanisms                                                             | Stream B: User Control Mechanisms                                                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Level 1        | Is there basic, informal communication to users regarding data use and AI operations?              | Are informal processes in place to occasionally respond to user data control requests?                       |
| Level 2        | Are clear, formal transparency practices regularly provided to users regarding AI data usage?      | Are structured mechanisms in place to facilitate user control over personal data?                            |
| Level 3        | Is comprehensive transparency proactively maintained, with ongoing user communication and updates? | Are advanced user control mechanisms fully integrated, continuously improved, and audited for effectiveness? |
