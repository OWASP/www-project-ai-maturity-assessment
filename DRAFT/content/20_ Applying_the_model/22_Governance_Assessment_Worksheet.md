## Governance Assessment Worksheet

Below is a sample **Governance domain assessment worksheet**, modeled after the OWASP SAMM Governance worksheet. It is organized by practice (Strategy & Metrics, Policy & Compliance, Education & Awareness) and grouped by maturity level. For each question, an assessor would mark **Yes or No** to indicate whether the organization currently fulfills that criterion. Achieving all “Yes” answers in Level 1 for a given practice indicates maturity Level 1 is attained; all Level 1 and Level 2 “Yes” indicates Level 2, and so on. (Partial “Yes” in the next level would be noted as a “+” as discussed.)


#### Strategy & Metrics – Aligning AI initiatives with business strategy and measuring AI program effectiveness.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Strategy Alignment                                                                             | Stream B: Metric Management                                                              |
| -------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1        | Is there an initial AI strategy documented, even informally?                                             | Are there any metrics informally tracked related to AI initiatives?                      |
| Level 2        | Has the AI strategy been formally defined and communicated to stakeholders?                              | Are defined metrics regularly reviewed and communicated within the organization?         |
| Level 3        | Is the AI strategy integrated into the organization's broader business strategy and iteratively refined? | Are metrics systematically analyzed to drive improvements and decision-making processes? |


#### Policy and Compliance – Establishing AI policies and meeting legal/ethical requirements.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Policy Development                                                                                                                           | Stream B: Compliance Management                                                                                                                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Level 1        | Is there an awareness or initial informal policy for AI usage within the organization?                                                                 | Is there basic awareness of compliance needs relevant to AI (e.g., GDPR, ethical guidelines)?                                                       |
| Level 2        | Has a formal AI policy been established and clearly communicated to all relevant stakeholders?                                                         | Are compliance requirements identified, documented, and regularly reviewed to ensure alignment with AI-specific regulations?                        |
| Level 3        | Is the AI policy consistently enforced and reviewed regularly for relevance, accuracy, and alignment with organizational goals and external standards? | Is compliance management applied through formal mechanisms into daily operations, with proactive management of compliance risks and regular audits? |


#### Education and Awareness – Training and guiding personnel on secure and ethical AI.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: AI Security Training                                                                                                     | Stream B: Awareness and Communication                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Level 1        | Is there initial informal training or general awareness about AI security risks within the organization?                           | Is communication about AI security risks sporadic or ad hoc?                                                                                     |
| Level 2        | Are formal training programs on AI security established, targeting key stakeholders and teams?                                     | Is there regular communication about AI security best practices and updates across the organization?                                             |
| Level 3        | Are AI security training programs regularly updated, mandatory, and effectively tailored for different roles and responsibilities? | Is there an established culture of proactive communication, continuous awareness, and engagement around AI security throughout the organization? |


Each section above corresponds to one of the Governance practices in AIMA. An assessor would review each question with stakeholders, mark Yes/No, and then determine the maturity level achieved. For instance, if **Strategy & Metrics** has all Level 1 and Level 2 questions answered “Yes,” but not all of Level 3, the score would be **Level 2+** for that practice. This worksheet format ensures a **structured yet flexible** assessment: it captures granular practices through yes/no checklists while mirroring the SAMM style that stakeholders may already be familiar with, now applied to the domain of AI.
