## Operations Assessment Worksheet for AIMA

Below is a sample **Operations domain assessment worksheet** for AIMA. It is organized by practice (Incident Management, Event Management, Operational Management) and grouped by maturity level. For each question, an assessor would mark **Yes or No** to indicate whether the organization currently fulfills that criterion. Achieving all “Yes” answers in Level 1 for a given practice indicates maturity Level 1 is attained; all Level 1 and Level 2 “Yes” indicates Level 2, and so on. (Partial “Yes” in the next level would be noted as a “+” as discussed.)

### Incident Management – Handling and resolving AI system incidents effectively.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Incident Response Preparedness                                                          | Stream B: Continuous Improvement and Reporting                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1        | Are there basic informal procedures or ad hoc responses for managing AI incidents?                | Are incidents informally documented and occasionally resolved?                              |
| Level 2        | Is there a documented and consistently applied incident response procedure for AI systems?        | Are incidents systematically managed, documented, and regularly reviewed?                   |
| Level 3        | Are incident response processes fully integrated, continuously improved, and regularly exercised? | Are incident handling and resolution proactively managed, optimized, and regularly audited? |

### Event Management – Monitoring and managing AI system events.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: Detection & Alerting                                                 | Stream B:  Response & Continuous Learning                                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Level 1        | Is there informal or occasional monitoring and detection of events in AI systems?        | Are event responses informally conducted and sporadically documented?                |
| Level 2        | Are events systematically monitored and consistently detected through defined processes? | Are event responses systematically executed, documented, and regularly reviewed?     |
| Level 3        | Is event monitoring continuously refined, comprehensively managed, and fully automated?  | Is event response proactively managed, continuously improved, and regularly audited? |

### Operational Management – Ensuring secure and efficient operational management of AI systems.

| Maturity Level | Stream A: System Monitoring & Maintenance                                               | Stream B: Security & Compliance Management                                                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1        | Are operational management procedures occasionally applied informally to AI systems?         | Is operational effectiveness informally monitored and occasionally addressed?                       |
| Level 2        | Are systematic operational procedures clearly defined, documented, and consistently applied? | Is operational effectiveness regularly assessed with improvements systematically implemented?       |
| Level 3        | Are operational processes fully integrated, consistently managed, and continuously refined?  | Is operational effectiveness proactively managed, comprehensively optimized, and regularly audited? |
