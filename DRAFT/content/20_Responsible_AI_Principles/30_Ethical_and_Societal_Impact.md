| **1 - Basic**   | AI ethics and societal impact are discussed informally or on a case-by-case basis.     | AI systems are deployed with minimal consideration for broader societal consequences.            |
| **2 - Intermediate** | Ethical considerations, including societal impacts, are defined during AI system design. | Ethical reviews and impact assessments are integrated into the development process.              |
| **3 - Advanced** | Ethical and societal impact requirements are formalized, documented, and prioritized.   | Continuous monitoring and remediation processes are in place to address societal and ethical challenges. |
