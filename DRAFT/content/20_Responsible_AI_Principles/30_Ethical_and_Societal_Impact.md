## Ethical Values and Societal Impact
Ethical values are fundamental in the design, development and implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. As AI technologies increasingly influence various aspects of society and the world we live in, it is critical to ensure that these systems are in line with ethical values such as the centrality of the Human Being, the Well-Being of the Human Being, respect for Human Rights, compliance with the Law, respect for the Environment.
Addressing these issues involves proactively identifying and mitigating potential negative impacts to human beings and the environment. By incorporating ethical considerations into AI practices, organizations can build stakeholder trust, comply with regulatory requirements, and contribute positively to the communities and world in which we live.


**Objectives of Ethical Values and Societal Impact in AI Systems:**

1) Promote Human-Centric: AI must be conceived, designed, developed and used as a tool to serve the human being.​
2) Support Human Well-Being: AI's ultimate goal is the improvement of Human well-being.​
3) Safeguard Fundamental Rights: AI must always respect, protect and promote the rights of the human being, as a person and as a community.
4) Ensure Rule of Law: AI must always comply with existing and applicable laws and regulations​.
5) Secure Environmental Protection: AI must promote environmental sustainability and the well-being of ecosystems throughout their life cycle.​
6) Encourage Stakeholder Engagement: Involve diverse stakeholders in the design, development and evaluation of AI systems to reflect a broad range of perspectives and values.


### Ethical Values & Societal Impact Implementation Maturity Model

| **Maturity Stage** | **Practice Actions (Org + Project)** | **Cultural Actions** |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **1 – Reactive**  <br> _Ethical considerations are handled on a case-by-case basis with no formal frameworks or responsibilities._ | - Ethical concerns are addressed only when issues arise, without consistent assessment practices. <br> - Responsibility for ethical decisions is assigned informally and reactively. <br> - Ethical documentation occurs post-incident with limited follow-up or learning. | - Ethical discussions are informal and occasional, often driven by individual initiative. <br> - There is no structured training or support for ethical decision-making. <br> - Awareness of ethics varies across teams without shared expectations. |
| **2 – Structured**  <br> _Ethical policies and roles are established to guide responsible AI development and decision-making._ | - A formal AI ethics policy defines values, principles and responsibilities across the organization. <br> - Ethics Officers or Committees are appointed to oversee practices and governance. <br> - Ethical impact assessments are integrated into planning and documentation processes. | - Teams receive ethics training to support role-specific responsibilities. <br> - Open forums and discussions about ethical dilemmas are encouraged and supported. <br> - Ethical reflection becomes part of the team’s regular project routines. |
| **3 – Embedded**  <br> _Ethical and societal impacts are continuously evaluated, monitored, and embedded into the organization’s culture and processes._ | - Ethical KPIs are tracked and linked to organizational performance metrics and reviews. <br> - Policies are regularly updated based on real-world feedback and stakeholder engagement. <br> - Ethics tools and continuous monitoring are integrated into all project phases. | - Ethical behavior is recognized and rewarded as part of career growth and team success. <br> - A culture of proactive ethical thinking is reinforced through events, exercises, and leadership modeling. <br> - Ethical considerations are normalized across all levels of decision-making. |
